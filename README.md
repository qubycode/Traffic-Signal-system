# 🚦 Traffic Signal System Simulation

This is a multithreaded Java project that simulates a four-way traffic signal system. Each direction (North, South, East, West) is managed with green, yellow, and red lights using Java Threads and synchronization.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Java Multithreading
- Thread Synchronization
- ANSI Color Codes for Console Output
- Sleep/Delay for Timing Signals

## 💻 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qubycode/Traffic-Signal-System.git
````

2. **Compile the Java Program**

   ```bash
   cd Traffic-Signal-System
   javac Main.java
   ```

3. **Run the Program**

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

*Note: Colored output works best in terminals that support ANSI escape codes.*

## 🖥️ Sample Console Output

```
North signal is GREEN
South signal is RED
East signal is RED
West signal is RED
```

## 📦 Requirements

* JDK 8 or above
* Java-supported IDE or terminal
